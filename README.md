# Algorithms and DataStructures Solutions - JavaScript

## Introduction

- This repository contains JavaScript attempts on algorithm and data structures questions gotten from multiple sources such as [Cracking the Coding Interview (CTCI) 6th edition](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/), [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) and [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/).  

- The files only contain code, and do not contain ANY question. For CTCI questions, please support [Gayle Laakmann McDowell](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gaylemcd) by purchasing the [book](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850). For other questions you can find them for free on their respective platforms.

- In each JavaScript file, there are simple tests to check that the code is working as expected. For convenience, simple logging is used to test the functions. In your terminal type `node <path-to-fileName>.js` to run the tests.
